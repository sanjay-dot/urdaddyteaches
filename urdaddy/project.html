		<h3>What is Machine Learning</h3>
		<p>Machine learning is an application of <em>artificial intelligence</em> (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</p>

		<b class="heading">Supervised Learning</b>
		<p>When models are trained with these examples, we can use them to make new predictions on unseen data. The predicted labels can be both numbers or categories. For instance, if we are predicting house prices, then the output is a number. In this case, the model is a regression mode</p>

<h4 id="change">Example</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Image Classification</b>:<p>Image classification is a popular problem in the computer vision field. Here, the goal is to predict what class an image belongs to. In this set of problems, we are interested in finding the class label of an image. More precisely: is the image of a car or a plane? A cat or a dog?</li></p><br>

	<li><b>Weather Prediction:</b><p>To Make a correct predictions for the weather, we need to take into account various parameters, including historical temperature data, precipitation, wind, humidity, and so on.This particularly interesting and challenging problem may require developing complex supervised models that include multiple tasks. Predicting today’s temperature is a regression problem<br></p></li>

	<li><b>House Price Predictions:</b><p>Data about the houses: square footage, number of rooms, features, whether a house has a garden or not, and so on. We then need to know the prices of these houses, i.e. the corresponding labels. By leveraging data coming from thousands of houses, their features and prices, we can now train a supervised machine learning model to predict a new house’s price based on the examples observed by the model. <br></p></li>
</ul>


<b class="heading">Unsupervised Learning</b>
<p>The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.</p>
<h4 id="change">Example</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Clustering</b>: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.</li><br>

	<li><b>Association</b>:  An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y</li></p>
</ul>
